### Submission
1. Create a Pull Request (PR) with:
    a. Your DEPLOYMENT.md file detailing the deployment process.
    b. Any code changes required for the deployment.
2. Ensure your PR includes:
    a. Detailed step-by-step instructions.
    b. Clear documentation of any issues encountered and how they were resolved.
    c. Verification steps to demonstrate the successful deployment.

## Completeness

1. All steps from setup to deployment must be documented.
2. The documentation must include necessary configurations and modifications.
3. The process must be replicable using the provided instructions.

#### Functionality

1. The deployed application must run without errors.
2. All features of the application should function as intended.
